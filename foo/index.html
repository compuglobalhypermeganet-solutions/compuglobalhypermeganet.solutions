<p>Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything. And Apple has been – well, first of all, one’s very fortunate if you get to work on just one of these in your career.</p>

<p>Apple’s been very fortunate. It’s been able to introduce a few of these into the world.</p>

<p>In 1984, we introduced the Macintosh. It didn’t just change Apple, it changed the whole computer industry.</p>

<p>In 2001, we introduced the first iPod, and… it didn’t just – it didn’t just change the way we all listen to music, it changed the entire music industry.</p>

<p>Well, today, we’re introducing three revolutionary products of this class.</p>

<p>The first one: is a widescreen iPod with touch controls.</p>

<p>The second: is a revolutionary mobile phone.</p>

<p>And the third is a breakthrough Internet communications device.</p>

<p>So, three things: a widescreen iPod with touch controls; a revolutionary mobile phone; and a breakthrough Internet communications device.</p>

<p>An iPod, a phone, and an Internet communicator. An iPod, a phone … Are you getting it?</p>

<p>These are not three separate devices, this is one device, and we are calling it iPhone.</p>

<p>Today, today Apple is going to reinvent the phone, and here it is.</p>

<p>No, actually here it is, but we’re gonna leave it there for now.</p>

<p>So, before we get into it, let me uh talk about a category of things. The most advanced phones are called smart phones. So they say.</p>

<p>And uh they typically combine a phone plus some e-mail capability, plus they say it’s the Internet. It’s sort of the baby Internet, into one device, and they all have these plastic little keyboards on them.</p>

<p>And the problem is that they’re not so smart and they’re not so easy to use, so if you kinda make a… Business School 101 graph of the smart axis and the easy-to-use axis, phones, regular cell phones are kinda right there, they’re not so smart, and they’re – you know – not so easy to use.</p>

<p>Umm… But smart phones are definitely a little smarter, but they actually are harder to use. They’re really complicated. Just for the basic stuff a hard time figuring out how to use them.</p>

<p>Well, we don’t wanna do either one of these things. What we wanna do is make a leapfrog product that is way smarter than any mobile device has ever been, and super-easy to use.</p>

<p>This is what iPhone is. OK?</p>

<p>So, we’re gonna reinvent the phone.</p>
